## Installing Python (with [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

### Uninstall `conda`

As we are using `pyenv` to install and manage our Python version, we need to uninstall [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/), another package manager you may have on your machine if you previously installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Thus, we are preventing any possible Python version issue later.

Check if you have `conda` installed on your machine:

```bash
conda list
```

$MAC_START
If you have `zsh: command not found: conda`, you can **skip** the uninstall of `conda` and jump to the **Install pre-requisites** section.
$MAC_END
$LINUX_START
If you have `zsh: command not found: conda`, you can **skip** the uninstall of `conda` and jump to the **Install `pyenv`** section.
$LINUX_END
$WINDOWS_START
If you have `zsh: command not found: conda`, you can **skip** the uninstall of `conda` and jump to the **Install `pyenv`** section.
$WINDOWS_END
