  <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è How to find the absolute path of a file?</summary>
  You can drag and drop the file in your terminal.
</details>

**Restart** your terminal and run:

``` bash
echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

The ouptut should be the following:

```bash
/some/absolute/path/to/your/gcp/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_FILE_CONTAINING_YOUR_SECRET_KEY.json
```

Now let's verify that the path to your service account json file is correct:

``` bash
cat $(echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)
```

üëâ This command should display the content of your service account json file. If it does not, ask for a TA üôè

Your code and utilities are now able to access the resources of your GCP account.

Let's proceed with the final steps of configuration...

- List the service accounts associated to your active account and current project

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list
```

- Retrieve the service account email address, e.g. `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- List the roles of the service account from the cli (replace PROJECT_ID and SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL)

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
--flatten="bindings[].members" \
--format='table(bindings.role)' \
--filter="bindings.members:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
```

- You should see that your service account has a role of `roles/owner`
