## Chrome - your browser

Install the Google Chrome browser if you haven't got it already and set it as a __default browser__.

Follow the steps for your system from this link :point_right: [Install Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB)

__Why Chrome?__

We recommend to use it as your default browser as it's most compatible with testing or running your code, as well as working with Google Cloud Platform. Another alternative is Firefox, however we don't recommend using other tools like Opera, Internet Explorer or Safari.
